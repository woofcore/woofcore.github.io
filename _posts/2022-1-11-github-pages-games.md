Hosting webgl games is super easy!

<!--more-->

A couple of months back I made a quick platformer in Godot as a test to figure out how webgl game hosting works and it turns out you can just upload the export straight to github and it runs! Also despite this site running Jekyll, linking to github projects works just fine. This is probably a very obvious and intended feature, but it completely blows my feeble little mind.

Here's [the link](https://woofz.one/webgl-test) if you're interested, though fair warning it's nothing worth playing and I don't own the music!

The main thing that excites me about this is that I can pretty much just upload any game I make in Godot (provided it can actually run in the browser) straight to my website and it just *works*!

Watch this space!
