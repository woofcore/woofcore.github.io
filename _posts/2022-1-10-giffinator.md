a simple batch program to quickly convert a mp4 or image sequence to a gif.

important: you must have FFMpeg installed or the exe in the working directory for this to work. There is an executable included in the .zip, but be way that it definitely is not the latest version. 

# Download:


# Useage:
The program should have instructions built in, but just in case:
* Input the file type by typing either PNG or MP4.
* Input the file name. If it's a PNG sequence, input the filename with the numbers removed. (Note: the filename should have 4 digits in the suffix, for example file0001.png to file9999.png)
* Input the framerate.
* Input the output filename. This can be whatever you like!
* Wait! Longer animations will take longer to render.
* Finally you should have a GIF. If you're intending to upload this somewhere, its a good idea to use something like ezgif to optimize it.

# Why?
I couldn't find any programs where I could simply input a file and get a gif out without a bunch of other features. Like seriously why isn't there just a straightforward ffmpeg gui out there?
There almost definitely is but I'm lazy and love the .bat aesthetic too much.

When I have time I'll write a better program with a gui or something.
